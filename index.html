      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Arrays: are a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Typicly used to hold data that is
          related in some way</li>
        <li>Index: is the location of the data item in the array. It uses a unique idetifying number</li>
        <li>Loops: are used when an array has many items. Instead of writing all the console.logs out we use a Loops
        </li>
        <li>FOR loop: uses the preictable pattern indices to prefor a task on all the items in an array by using a
          single code block to be exicuted over and over</li>
        <li>Starting point for a loop: we use variable 'x' and it gets a '0' "because the first index of an array is
          always 0, not 1. ex: var x=0</li>
        <li>Second statement condition: as long as the number in the varible 'x' is less than the length of the array
          the loop keeps running.
          Use 'length' built in to the array to express the condition ex: x < 'shapes' .lenght </li>
        <li>Final: allows the array to iterate over each item. Idices follow predictive pattern, the number increases by
          1 each time.
          Code x++ is short writing for x+1. Now everytime the code loops x will increase by 1 ex: (var x=0
          <'shapes'.length;x++){ console.log(shapes[x])}</li>
